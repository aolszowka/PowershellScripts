# RenameDanielTiger
These scripts were originally created on 2023/10/19 to support renaming a
significant number of MKV files (Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood), whose filenames
were incorrect, but they did have the title of the episode in them.

While I doubt this script will ever be used again, it was a fun project that I
thought should be preserved.
