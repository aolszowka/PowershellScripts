# PowershellScripts
Repository for various Powershell Scripts I create and wish to share.

## Design Goals
All scripts should be:
* Self Contained
* Easily Extensible by third parties
* Well Documented
* Get-Help command should be useful for all scripts; including examples
* Licensed permissively as possible
